 - write comments for each method demonestrates the action of the method the params it recieves and the type of the return value.
 - Test classes for each single operation
 - Clean code.

 - Joins, fields Type, consider add index to fields which will be in where condition or order by.
 -  Use sub-queries wisely 
 - Variable names: CamelCase "$userInfo".
 - Method names: CamelCase "createUser".
 - Class Names: Upper camel case "PagesDescription"
 - Constants:  Upper case "PUBLIC_FOLDER_PATH"
 - Don't use '_' anywhere except DB table and fields name, constants, and enum values (which are constants).
 - Do not user Uppercase in SQL, as mentioned above use underscore to seperate words
